Cloud Custodian enables you to manage your cloud resources by filtering, tagging, and then applying actions to them. The YAML DSL allows defininition of rules to enable well-managed cloud infrastructure that's both secure and cost optimized. 

Replace ad-hoc cloud-specific scripts with simpler syntax, and Cloud Custodian will apply those policies to your infrastructure:
